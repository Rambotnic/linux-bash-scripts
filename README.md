# Bash Scripts for [Fedora 42 KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/)
These are some bash scripts I've made to make my life easier when installing/removing packages because I seriously can't be bothered to use the terminal to do shit manually... üòì

I also have old scripts for when I was using Kubuntu. Checkout to [this branch](https://github.com/TheRambotnic/linux-bash-scripts/tree/kubuntu) if you want those scripts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING...
Don't just trust any random script you find on this site. If you intend to use these scripts, then **PLEASE** look at the code first and understand what it's doing. I may or may not be removing/installing stuff that you don't want, so feel free to change it for your use case.

## Included:
* Remove Bloatware.sh
* Install Essentials.sh
* [Vencord Installer.sh](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord)
* [scrcpy.sh](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy)

**HOW TO USE:** Open the scripts folder in the terminal and type `sudo chmod a+x ./*`, then run file you want.
